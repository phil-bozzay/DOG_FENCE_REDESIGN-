## Current Status
IN PROGRESS/ CLOSE TO FINISH

## Project Overview
Oscillator with center frequency of 10khz, and voltage amplitude from 1v-10v. Must run off of a +12volt supply and with a frequency range from 9.5k to 10.5k. 
Drive a 100ohm load with lightning protection.
## Educational Value Added
Electronic circuit design (oscillator, amplifier, fault protection) and custom pcb design. 

## Tasks
- Generate negative 12 volt supply from positive input that can output |200mA| of current
- Make center frequency adjustable (pot, variable capacitor)
- Add neon bulb to protect againts static electricity
