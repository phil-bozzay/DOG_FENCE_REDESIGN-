## Current Status
IN PROGRESS/ CLOSE TO FINISH

## Project Overview
Oscillator with center frequency of 10khz, and voltage amplitude from 1v-10v. Must run off of a +12volt supply and with a frequency range from 9.5k to 10.5k. 
Drive a 100ohm load with lightning protection.
## Educational Value Added
Electronic circuit design (oscillator, amplifier, fault protection) and custom pcb design. 

## Tasks
- add ground plane without ruining the converter 
- fix L1, L2 footprint
- switch potentiometer footprints
- verify frequency response 
- add lightning protection 

## Parts Order list 
- MBR0520L diode           (x1)
- LT1931A DC-DC converter  (x1)
- CR43NP-100MC inductors   (x2)
